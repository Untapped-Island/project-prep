## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

### Describe at least

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

xyz

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

xyz

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

xyz

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

xyz

## Conflict Plan

> Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

## Communication Plan

> Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

### Communication Hours

9:00AM-6:00PM

### Communication Platforms

Slack, Github, Phone, Remo

### How often will you take breaks?

Hourly - 10 minute breaks

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Mob Coding sessions could help. If we notice that our MVP is out of reach, we will reevaluate the MVP in an Agile manner.

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Slack / Phone will be our main source of communication after horus.

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Morning stand-up meetings and evening close outs

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Open communication, reassure this is a safe environment

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Goal setting in the morning - Establish feature tasks every day for each person 
Check off goals and accomplishments every evening and readjust goals for tomorrow if need be.

### What project management tool will be used?

Github Projects

### [Presentation Deck]()

## Git Process

> Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

### Basic rules
- Commit and push changes to a feature branch. When the feature is complete or

Describe at least:

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

The project repo, Terminal Client Repo, and all the code that is not within the database.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

An organization has been built with all members included as admins.

### What is your Git flow?

The repo will be live for all members to edit the code. In addition, members can pull the repo into their local machine and work on seperate branches.
We will also acp when necessary, or when we have completed our designated feature tasks.

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider

Yes, two of the members need to approve the PR before the member has the ability to merge.

### How many people must review a PR?

Two

### Who merges PRs?

Whoever is available at the time for the dev branch. And the designated main member to merge all code into the main branch.

### How often will you merge

For the dev, merge as need (no definitive number), and once a day for main branch

### How will you communicate that it’s time to merge

The member will communicate with all members so that they are aware, showcase their code, and push their code into the PR.
